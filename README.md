# ev_sports_betting
This repo contains various scripts and functionality to scan numerous american sportbooks and return positive expected value bets, along with the corresponding appropriate bet size, according to the Kelly Criterion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion#Gambling_formula

This is more of a repo so I am able to keep track of changes, but I am open to all questions and/or potential improvements, so feel free to reach out
